* window-stool-mode
A minor mode to show code context for code above the window similar to the excellent context.vim plugin.
Like a little stool for your window that you can use to view stuff in the buffer above the window.

Using only indentation means we can use this in non treesitter based modes as well, but I'm not
against adding some treesitter support (I just need to find time to dig into the treesitter api)

It can be a little janky at times, since I had to do some hacky things with overlays since headerline doesn't
support multiple lines. It works pretty well with my usage of mostly golang and elisp of course.

** Motivation
I really liked context.vim when I was using vim and I couldn't really find something that fit exactly.
There's which-function-mode and lsp-breadcrumbs as well as topsy that I tried, all amazing in their own right
but I wanted something to call my own and to scratch that itch.

* Installation

With emacs 29 we have built in package-vc-install
#+begin_src elisp
  (package-vc-install "https://github.com/JasZhe/window-stool")
#+end_src

With straight:
#+begin_src elisp
  (straight-use-package
   '(window-stool :type git :host github :repo "jaszhe/window-stool"))
#+end_src

With doom:
#+begin_src elisp
  (package! window-stool :recipe (:host github :repo "jaszhe/window-stool" :files ("*.el")))
#+end_src

Add a hook to prog-mode (or any other mode) with a use-package config
#+begin_src elisp
  (use-package window-stool
    :config
    (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'window-stool-mode))
#+end_src

* TODO [0/1]
** TODO maybe org/markdown specific rules
i.e. stars instead of indentation
