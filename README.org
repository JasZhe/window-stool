* code-context-mode
A minor mode to show code context for code above the window similar to the excellent context.vim plugin.

Using only indentation means we can use this in non treesitter based modes

* Similar packages
treesitter-context - uses posframe instead of overlays, treesitter
topsy - one line only


* PROJ to be added [1/4]
** TODO maybe org specific rules
i.e. stars instead of indentation

** TODO limit the amount of context
so we don't have half the screen filled with context

** DONE option to use persistent window instead of overlays

** TODO disable overlays when multiple windows showing the same buffer
cause it messes with the overlays a lot

** TODO clean up code
